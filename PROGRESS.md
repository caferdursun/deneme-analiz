# Development Progress Tracker

**Project**: Deneme Analiz - University Exam Tracker
**Student**: Eren Dursun
**Started**: 2025-10-26
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-26

## Current Status

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation & Core PDF Analysis
**Overall Progress**: 5%
**Current Sprint**: Environment setup and initial planning

---

## Completed Tasks

### 2025-10-26 - Project Initialization

#### Documentation Created ✅
- [x] CLAUDE.md - Project context and guidance for future Claude instances
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md - Detailed system architecture and design
- [x] PLAN.md - Phase-by-phase development roadmap
- [x] PROGRESS.md - This file for tracking implementation

#### Initial Data ✅
- [x] Downloaded first exam PDF (exam.pdf)
- [x] Analyzed exam structure and format
- [x] Identified data extraction requirements

**Key Decisions Made**:
- Tech stack: FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL + Claude API
- Database schema designed (see ARCHITECTURE.md)
- 5-phase iterative development approach
- Focus on single-student MVP first, multi-user later

**Files Created**:
- `/root/projects/deneme-analiz/CLAUDE.md`
- `/root/projects/deneme-analiz/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `/root/projects/deneme-analiz/PLAN.md`
- `/root/projects/deneme-analiz/PROGRESS.md`
- `/root/projects/deneme-analiz/exam.pdf`

## In Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core PDF Analysis

**Current Task**: Environment Setup
**Started**: 2025-10-26
**Target Completion**: TBD

#### Pending Tasks
- [ ] Initialize Git repository
- [ ] Create directory structure
- [ ] Set up Python virtual environment
- [ ] Install core dependencies
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up database
- [ ] Create database models
- [ ] Initialize Alembic for migrations
- [ ] Implement Claude API client
- [ ] Create PDF analysis prompt
- [ ] Build basic API endpoints

## Blockers & Issues

### Current Blockers
None at the moment.

### Open Questions
1. Should we use SQLite for development or go straight to PostgreSQL?
   - **Decision needed**: Consider using SQLite for quick start, migrate to PostgreSQL later
2. Claude API key - do we have it ready?
   - **Action**: User needs to provide Anthropic API key
3. Hosting preference for production?
   - **Action**: Defer to Phase 5
